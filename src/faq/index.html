          "<quote>the U.S. government uses it to protect internal communications, the Tor project uses it to help assure
            anonymity, it is the mechanism used to prove ownership of bitcoins, it provides signatures in Apple's
            iMessage service, it is used to encrypt DNS information with DNSCurve, and it is the preferred method for
            authentication for secure web browsing over SSL/TLS.</quote>"-<a

            could ever
            be made) would, in theory, require about 3×10<sup>51</sup> years to exhaust the 256-bit key space.</quote>"

        <h2>"Can you explain how this works to me in more detail?"</h2>
        <p>Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) is used for both sides to establish a shared secret. We chose Curve25519
          because it is considered the most secured curve. The shared secret is then pass through PBKDF2 with 3000000
          iterations and 16 bits of random data as salt to derive a 256 bit AES key. The message or file is then
          encrypted with AES-GCM.

        <p>Encryption links are of the form:<br>

        <p>Decryption links are of the form:<br>
          https://SecretDrop.io/decrypt/?key=[private key]</p>
        <p>Encrypted messages are of the form:<br>"[encryption side public key string],[{[PBKDF2 salt length (4
          bytes)][PBKDF2 salt][iv (12 bytes)][encrypted binary of lz-utf8 string]} in base64]"
        </p>
        <p>Encrypted files are of the form:<br>{[encryption side public key length (4 bytes)][encryption side public
          key][PBKDF2 salt length (4 bytes)][PBKDF2 salt][iv (12 bytes)][encrypted binary]}</p>
